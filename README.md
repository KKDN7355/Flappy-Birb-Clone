# Flappy Bird Clone

Flappy Bird Clone is a JavaScript-based 2D arcade-style game that challenges players to navigate a bird through a series of pipes without crashing. This project is built using HTML5 Canvas for rendering and JavaScript for game mechanics, animation, sound integration, and event handling. The game features gravity inversion, pipe obstacles, score tracking, and sound effects, making for an engaging and fun experience.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 

I made this by translating code I wrote in Java from this repository: https://github.com/KKDN7355/Flappy-Bird-Clone

Purely so if anyone wanted to try it out, they can do so here: https://kkdn7355.github.io/Flappy-Birb-Clone/

### Prerequisites

- **Web Browser**: A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.) is required to play the game.

No installation of additional software is needed.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappy-bird-clone.git
   cd flappy-bird-clone
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html  # For macOS
   start index.html  # For Windows
   ```

The game should now be running in your browser.

## Running the Game

1. To start playing, simply click or press the space bar (or enter) on the keyboard to begin the game.

2. Use the space bar or left mouse click to control the bird's movement. The bird will "flap" and rise in the air each time the space bar is pressed.

3. The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or flies off the screen.

### Controls

- **Spacebar**: Flap the bird to rise

## Features

- **Gravity Inversion**: Some pipes contain a gravity inverter that flips the gravitational direction when collided with.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the current score and the best score.
- **Sound Effects**: Various sound effects play for actions like jumping, scoring, and dying.
- **Pipes**: Randomly generated pipes appear, and the player must avoid hitting them.

## Built With

* **HTML5 Canvas** - For rendering the game scene
* **JavaScript** - For game logic and interactions
* **Audio** - For sound effects and background music

## Future Additions

- **Leaderboard Integration**:
  - Save and display high scores locally or online.

- **Gravity Inversion**:
  - Implement a feature that sits between pipes that inverts gravity.

- **Achievements**:
  - Add unlockable achievements to enhance gameplay experience.

- **Enhanced Graphics**:
  - Include more detailed animations and background elements.

- **Mobile Compatibility**:
  - Adapt the game for touchscreens and smaller resolutions.
